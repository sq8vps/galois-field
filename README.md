# Simple Galois field library in C++
A very simple Galois field library for GF(p)

## Getting Started

As said above, it handles Galois fields GF(p), where p is any 16-bit prime number. Doesn't support GF(p^n) (at least for now).

## Capabilites

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication (using lookup tables or typical calculation)
* Division
* Power
* Inverse
* Prime number generation
